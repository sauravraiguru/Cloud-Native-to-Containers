To understand the topics we would be talking in depth in the hands-on lab on day 1, here are a few videos that will get you upto speed. 

### Intro to Cloud Native

Cloud native applications are composed of reusable components known as microservices and are designed to integrate into any cloud environment. This flexible and scalable approach is ideal for enterprises who are tasks with improving existing applications, building new applications, and enhancing user experience.

### What is Public Cloud?

Public cloud provides developers with the ability to provision resources on demand and only pay for what you use, but what makes up a public cloud?

Check out this quick overview video that provides an overview of public cloud by explaining the different compute solutions, levels of control, and capabilities that are all available in a public cloud.

### Containers vs VMs

What are virtual machines and containers, and how do they fit into our modern cloud-native way of building and architecting applications? 

In this lightboard video, Nigel Brown with IBM Cloud, answers this question and much more in four parts. He also breaks down why users should not just look at virtual machines and containers as competing technologies because there can be a lot of benefits of having them work together for particular use cases.

### Cloud Native DevOps

In this lightboard video, Sai Vennam and Matt Perrins with IBM Cloud walk through a scenario of taking an existing application and migrating it over to use a cloud-native approach in order to take advantage of increased scalability and higher-level services. These two cloud native experts also demonstrate how to best use DevOps principles to manage the building, testing, and deployment of the application's lifecycle.
